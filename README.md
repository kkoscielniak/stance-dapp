# Stance dApp

<!-- This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
``` -->

## Development
### Local node
To deploy Stance smart contract to a local Ethereum network:
1. Start Hardhat's local node with `yarn local-node`
2. Run `yarn local`
